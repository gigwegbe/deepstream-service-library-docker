# IMPORTANT! it is STRONGLY advised that you create a new, free Gmail account -- 
# that is seperate/unlinked from all your other email accounts -- strictly for 
# the purpose of sending ODE Event data uploaded from DSL.  Then, add your 
# Personal email address as a "To" address to receive the emails.
#
# Gmail considers regular email programs (i.e Outlook, etc.) and non-registered 
# third-party apps to be "less secure". The email account used for sending email 
# must have the "Allow less secure apps" option turned on. Once you've created 
# this new account, you can go to the account settings and enable Less secure 
# app access. see https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
